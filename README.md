secret-santa
============

A program to automatically divvy up secret santa assignments


In addition to emailing out the actual assignments so that no one will know the matchings, this program will allow you deny certain matchings to prevent some people from getting other people. In practice this allows you to prevent couples (and people who don't really know each other) from receiving each other.

The program will read a file named "santa.txt" for data on start. The format of this file is found in a comment in the source code. There is also a sample file contained in this repo.
