secret-santa
============

A program to automatically divvy up secret santa assignments


In addition to emailing out the actual assignments so that no one will know the matchings, this program will allow you deny certain matchings to prevent some people from getting other people. In practice this allows you to prevent couples (and people who don't really know each other) from receiving each other.
